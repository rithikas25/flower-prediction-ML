### Flower Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the species of a flower based on its features such as petal length, petal width, sepal length, and sepal width. It uses the popular [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) as a benchmark to classify flowers into three species: *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*. The goal of this project is to explore classification algorithms and demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to real-world datasets.

#### Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, scaling numerical data, and encoding categorical data.
- **Model Training**: Experimentation with multiple classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of each model.
- **Visualization**: Visualizing the dataset and model performance using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

#### Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

#### Objectives
- To predict the species of a flower based on its measurements.
- To compare the performance of various classification models.
- To understand the impact of different hyperparameters and tuning techniques.

#### How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook `flower_prediction.ipynb` to explore the analysis, model training, and predictions.

#### Example Output
Upon running the model, the species of a given flower based on its attributes will be predicted, such as:
- Sepal Length: 5.1 cm
- Sepal Width: 3.5 cm
- Petal Length: 1.4 cm
- Petal Width: 0.2 cm

Predicted species: **Setosa**
